# Project KP 2024 Form as a Code: an Efficient Form-making Approach


The “Form as a Code” (FAAC) proposal aims to streamline the creation and management of web forms by using code to
define the structure and behavior of form elements. This approach brings the power of code to form development, enabling
easier maintenance, customization, and integration within various applications. By defining forms using a structured code
syntax, developers can achieve more dynamic and responsive form functionalities.
